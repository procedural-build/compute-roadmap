# Compute Roadmap
Public roadmap for Compute.  A cloud and API based computation engine for AEC industry
Procedural have applied and were given the [InnoBooster Grant](https://innovationsfonden.dk/en/programmes/innobooster) from Innovation Fund Denmark to complete a 10 month long (December 2020 - October 2021) project to develop our cloud simulation platform further. 

As part of our effort to document our progress, have we decided to share the roadmap here on Github for everybody to follow along.
Our hope is that by making the roadmap public it will encourage users to participate with feedback and suggestions helping us to make a better product.

# Get Involved!
The easiest way to get involved with the development of Compute is to start/watch this repo to get notifications on the activity. You are also very welcome to join the discussion on the [issues page](https://github.com/procedural-build/compute-roadmap/issues), where the individual features are listed out.

## Beta Testers
We are looking for beta testers as part of the InnoBooster project! The beta testers should come with feedback on the new features we release during the lifetime of our InnoBooster grant project. The expected features can be seen on the [Roadmap](https://github.com/procedural-build/compute-roadmap/projects/1)
If you are interested in becoming a beta tester please contact us at info@procedural.build

## What to Code?
Our [Grasshopper](https://github.com/procedural-build/ProceduralCS) and [Blender](https://github.com/procedural-build/procedural-blender) plugins are OpenSource and are here on Github. 
We appriciate any PR you submit, whatever it is fixing of spelling mistake, documentation improvements or actual code commits.
